Describe your changes in detail.

almost certainly belongs in the ha-mqtt-discoverable module instead.

<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. I'm happy to help! -->

- [ ] I have read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/unixorn/ha-mqtt-discovery-cli/blob/main/Contributing.md) document.
- [ ] All new and existing tests pass.
- [ ] Any scripts added use `#!/usr/bin/env interpreter` instead of potentially platform-specific direct paths (`#!/bin/sh` is an allowed exception)
- [ ] Scripts added/updated in this PR are all marked executable.
- [ ] Scripts added/updated in this PR _do not_ have a language file extension unless they are meant to be sourced and not run standalone. No one should have to know if a script was written in bash, python, ruby or whatever. Not including file extensions makes it easier to rewrite a script in another language later without having to change every reference to the previous version.
- [ ] I have confirmed that any links added or updated in my PR are valid.
